✨ Harmonize: A Responsible Gen AI Chatbot for Mental Health Support ✨
Welcome to the Harmonize project repository! This a capstone project built by a team of final-year B.Tech students specializing in AI/ML, Big Data, and Cybersecurity. Our mission is to leverage the power of Responsible Generative AI to create a secure, scalable, and empathetic chatbot that provides accessible mental health support.

💡 Project Vision
In a world where mental health support is often inaccessible, Harmonize aims to bridge the gap by offering an immediate, anonymous, and judgment-free space for individuals to find emotional support. We're not replacing professional care, but rather providing a compassionate first step and a safe haven for those in need.

🚀 Key Features
Empathetic AI-Powered Conversations: Our chatbot engages users in human-like, supportive conversations using a fine-tuned Generative AI model.

Fortified Security: User data is protected with end-to-end encryption, and a robust JWT authentication system ensures secure access.

Built-in Safety Guardrails: We've integrated Responsible AI principles to prevent the generation of harmful, biased, or dangerous advice, making user safety our top priority.

Scalable & Resilient Architecture: The application is containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes, ensuring it can handle high user traffic and maintain high availability.

Privacy-First Analytics: User interactions are anonymized and logged securely in our PostgreSQL database for performance analysis, without ever compromising personal privacy.

Automated Excellence: Our CI/CD pipeline (TBD) automates testing and deployment, guaranteeing a reliable and continuously updated service.
