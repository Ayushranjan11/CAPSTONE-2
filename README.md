#  Harmonize: A Responsible Gen AI Chatbot for Mental Health Support 

Welcome to the **Harmonize** project repository!  
This capstone project is built by a team of final-year B.Tech students specializing in **AI/ML, Big Data, and Cybersecurity**.  

Our mission is to leverage **Responsible Generative AI** to create a secure, scalable, and empathetic chatbot that provides **accessible mental health support**.

## 💡 Project Vision
Mental health support is often inaccessible. **Harmonize** aims to bridge this gap by offering an **immediate, anonymous, and judgment-free space** for individuals to find emotional support.  

We’re **not a replacement** for professional care, but a **compassionate first step** and a safe haven for those in need.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔒 Fortified Security** – End-to-end encryption with JWT authentication for secure access.  
- **🛡️ Safety Guardrails** – Responsible AI principles to prevent harmful, biased, or unsafe outputs.  
- **⚡ Scalable Architecture** – Dockerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes for high availability.  
- **📊 Privacy-First Analytics** – Anonymous interaction logs stored securely in PostgreSQL.  
- **🤖 Automated CI/CD (TBD)** – Continuous testing and deployment for reliable updates.
